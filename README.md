# Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Insurance-Sales-BDM-Capstone-Project

This project analyzes an insurance companyâ€™s policy sales data to uncover trends, customer segments, and factors influencing sales performance. Using MS Excel, I performed Pareto analysis, segmentation (low/medium/high spenders), and visualized key metrics like sum assured, premium distribution, and top-selling policies.

The findings helped identify high-value customer segments and recommend data-driven strategies to improve policy sales and targeting.
